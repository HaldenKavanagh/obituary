          <p>
            <strong>Michael:</strong>
            I own and operate Murphy & Associates Funeral Directors. In 2012,
            Pete and I had known each other from years of playing golf, and I
            had also known his in-laws well for decades. Once he stopped
            teaching, I asked him if he’d ever written an obituary. He replied
            by knocking his first try out of the park: The family was elated.
            Since then, Pete has been our go-to obituary writer/editor, and the
            praise from families continues with each one he pens. His writings
            come through with every ounce of objective information necessary, as
            well as whatever emotional tone the family requests. Furthermore,
            due to the nature of the business, we often call on Pete to put
            together obituaries with a quickly approaching deadline, and he’s
            always happy and able to work on a tight schedule.
