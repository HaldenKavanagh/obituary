        <p>
          <strong>Michael:</strong>
          I own and operate Murphy & Associates Funeral Directors. In 2012, Pete
          and I had known each other from years of playing golf, and I had also
          known his in-laws well for decades. Once he stopped teaching, I asked
          him if he’d ever written an obituary. He replied by knocking his first
          try out of the park: The family was elated. Since then, Pete has been
          our go-to obituary writer/editor, and the praise from families
          continues with each one he pens. His writings come through with every
          ounce of objective information necessary, as well as whatever
          emotional tone the family requests. Furthermore, due to the nature of
          the business, we often call on Pete to put together obituaries with a
          quickly approaching deadline, and he’s always happy and able to work
          on a tight schedule.
